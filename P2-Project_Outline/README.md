### Overview
Sendfriend is a Java/Spring web application that allows climbers to journal their method for solving ("sending") particlar routes. Climbers refer to this as their "beta", and the core of the app is providing a platform designs to allow climbers to capture this valuable information. The process of capturing this information will allow climbers to keep a detailed log of their attempts, what difficulty of climbs they've finished, and -- here's the friend part -- share their beta with other users.

As users save more and more information in the system they'll gain an idea of their progress, which will be visualized in a statistics section of their profile. I also hope to implement a map overlay to display the various areas that climbers have visited in their journey, allowing them to take a retrospective on their climbing experiences and trips.

### Features
Climbers can:
- Capture detailed notes about partcular routes -- grade, rating, beta, etc.
- Share their beta with other users -- or not.
- View their progression as a climber over time in a statistics section of the user profile.

### Technologies
- Backend - Java/Springboot
- MySQL persistence layer.
- Thymeleaf, Bootsrap and React for frontend views and statistics display.

### What I'll Have to Learn
- User authentication -- hashing+salting passwords in Java/Spring
- How to enable making user data public/private and sharable between users
- React and JavaScript for front end statistics and graph display
